# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Model-
we started a project to develop a TensorFlow and Keras-based breast cancer prediction model. 
The data was prepped and cleansed, a neural network model was created, and training was carried out. However, the findings and evaluation of the model are absent from the provided code. We would normally evaluate the model's performance, its applications, room for improvement, and its drawbacks in a thorough conclusion. We need the model evaluation and training outcomes in order to make relevant conclusions.

Model Performance: You should evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a test dataset.

Interpretation: Discuss the implications of your findings. For example, if the model performs well, it could be a useful tool for early breast cancer diagnosis. If not, it might require further refinement or additional data.

Future Work: Mention potential improvements or areas for future work. This could include trying different algorithms, data augmentation techniques, or gathering more data to enhance the model's accuracy.

Limitations: Acknowledge any limitations in the current model or dataset, such as data imbalance, potential biases, or other challenges.
